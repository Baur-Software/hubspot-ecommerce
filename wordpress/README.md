```

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.4+

- HubSpot account with API access
- Composer (for installation)

## HubSpot Setup

### Required Objects

- **Products**: Your product catalog

3. Add stages:
   - New Order
   - Processing
   - Shipped
   - Completed
   - Cancelled

Update the plugin to use your pipeline:

```php
// In includes/class-checkout.php, update the create_deal method
'pipeline' => 'your-pipeline-id'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Products not syncing

- Check API key is valid
- Ensure HubSpot account has products
- Check error log in HubSpot Shop → Dashboard

### Orders not creating in HubSpot
